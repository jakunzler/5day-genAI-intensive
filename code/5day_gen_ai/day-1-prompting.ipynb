    "# Day 1 - Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Kaggle 5-day Generative AI course!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to get started with the Gemini API and walk you through some of the example prompts and techniques that you can also read about in the Prompting whitepaper. You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n",
    "* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n",

    "\n",
    "### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n",
    "\n",
    "In the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers."

For millennia, it has been interwoven with the fabric of human civilization, impacting economies, cultures, and even landscapes.  Its significance transcends mere sustenance; the olive tree and its fruit represent a potent symbol of peace, prosperity, and resilience, its impact resonating across diverse aspects of contemporary life.\n",

      "One of the most prominent roles of olives in modern society is their contribution to the global economy.  Olive oil, the primary product derived from olives, is a multi-billion dollar industry, with Mediterranean countries like Spain, Italy, Greece, and Tunisia being major producers and exporters.  This economic activity generates employment opportunities across various sectors, from cultivation and harvesting to processing, packaging, and distribution.  Furthermore, the olive oil industry supports related businesses, including tourism, hospitality, and the production of olive-based cosmetics and pharmaceuticals\n"

He was content in his cozy home, nestled amidst piles of soft blankets and overflowing with tuna-scented kibble, but a gnawing desire for adventure always simmered within him. He’d spend his days gazing out the window, watching the world beyond his garden – the bustling streets, the rustling trees, the endless blue sky – a world begging to be explored.\n",

      "\n",
      "He scurried through the alleyways, dodging stray dogs and grumpy pigeons. He climbed a towering oak, the world spread out beneath him like a tapestry. He chased butterflies, their wings like stained glass against the sun, and danced with the wind, a playful tango on the rooftop.\n",
      "\n",
      "His journey took him to a bustling market, where he marveled at the vibrant colours and exotic smells. He met a gruff but kind old woman who offered him a bite of her delicious bread. He learned to navigate the city streets, a master of stealth and agility, avoiding the speeding cars and the hurried pedestrians.\n",
      "\n",
      "One evening, exhausted from his adventures, he found himself in a quiet park, the moon casting an ethereal glow on the sleeping city. He curled up on a bench, the gentle hum of crickets a lullaby. As he closed his eyes, a sense of peace washed over him. He had seen things, felt things, experienced things he had never dreamed possible. He wasn't just a tabby cat anymore; he was Barnaby the Explorer.\n",
      "\n",
      "He knew he couldn't stay out forever. The warmth of home, the comforting scent of his favourite blanket, the reassuring purrs of his human companion, all beckoned him back. With a reluctant sigh, Barnaby turned towards his home, his heart overflowing with memories and his spirit yearning for more. The world was vast and his adventures were far from over. He would return to his window, his eyes sparkling with newfound wisdom, his soul forever changed by his escapade. The world was waiting, and Barnaby, the tabby cat with a soul full of wanderlust, was ready to explore it again. \n",

       "\n",
       "**Why you'd use it:**\n",
       "\n",
       "* **Repository status:** You get a quick visual overview of your Git repository without having to explicitly run `git status`. This includes things like:\n",
       "    * The current branch name.\n",
       "    * Upstream branch status (ahead/behind).\n",
       "    * Number of staged, unstaged, and untracked files.\n",
       "    * Whether there are conflicts or stashes.\n",
       "    * If you are on a detached HEAD. \n",
       "* **Virtual environment awareness:** It can integrate with virtual environments (like `virtualenv` or `conda`) to display the active environment in your prompt.\n",
       "* **Customization:** You can tailor the appearance of your prompt (colors, symbols, etc.) by modifying configuration files or setting environment variables.\n",
       "\n",
       "**How it works:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Initialization:** The script checks for necessary files and defines functions for color handling, theme loading, and interacting with Git. \n",
       "2. **Git status:** It calls a Git command (`GIT_PROMPT_STATUS_COMMAND`) to get the current repository status.\n",
       "3. **Formatting:** The script formats the status information to be displayed in the prompt, using user-defined colors and symbols.\n",
       "4. **Integration:** It integrates with your shell's `PROMPT_COMMAND` variable to automatically update the prompt every time you execute a command.\n",
