## What is the 5-Day Generative AI Intensive?

Itâ€™s a 5-day online course on November 11 - 15 designed to help you deeply understand some of the fundamental technologies and techniques behind Generative AI. Created by a team of Googleâ€™s ML researchers and engineers, this program includes both conceptual deep dives and hands-on coding examples so you can tackle new Gen AI projects with confidence.

How does the intensive work?

### Everyday, participants will receive the following in their inbox

ðŸ“š Daily Assignments
This includes newly published white papers, a companion podcast (generated by [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/)), and companion code labs in AI Studio.

ðŸ’¬ Discord Discussion Threads
Kaggleâ€™s Discord server will have a dedicated channel for focused discussion on the reading. It's an excellent place to find further clarification, surface any questions, and connect with other learners.

ðŸŽ¥ Daily Livestream Seminars and AMAs
We're going live everyday on Kaggle's YouTube channel, where the authors and course contributors will dive deeper into the topics and answer your burning questions. Plus, we've got fun surprises in store to keep the learning engaging.

### FAQ

1. What are the course prerequisites? Who is this course for?

    This course is for anyone looking to more deeply understand the fundamentals of Generative AI. There are no firm prerequisites but knowing a bit of Python will help you get the most out of the codelabs and some experience with basic Generative AI concepts like prompting will help accelerate reading comprehension.

    If you have time before the course begins and need a basic refresher, we recommend taking our short [Intro to Programming (in Python) course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-programming), [Kaggle's Python course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) and the [Introduction to Generative AI micro-course from Google Cloud](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/course_templates/536).

2. What is the time commitments for the program?

    Assignments should take roughly 1-2 hours/day to complete and the live stream will be about 45-60 minutes long.

3. Will the livestreams be recorded?

    Yes! Registrants will receive the recordings afterward in case they can't make it live.

4. How much is the program?

    No cost â€“ all you need is a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) account and compatible [AI Studio account](https://aistudio.google.com/).

5. Who contributed to this course?

    This was a large team effort from a group of Google ML researchers and engineers including (in alphabetical order by last name) Christos Aniftos, Shekoofeh Azizi, Paige Bailley, Mohammadamin Barekatain, Lee Boonstra, Scott Coull, Omid Fatemieh, Josh Gordon, Wieland Holfelder, Logan Kilpatrick, Gabriela HernÃ¡ndez Larios, Yaniv Leviathan, Alan Li, Daniel J. Mankowitz, Patrick Marlow, Massimo Mascaro, Mark McDonald, Iftekhar Naim, Anant Nawalgaria, Yan Qiao, Xiaoqi Ren, Elia Secchi, Christopher Semturs, Aliaksei Severyn, Umesh Shankar, Michael Styer, Julia Wiesinger, and many others.

6. Will the course award a Kaggle certificate, medals, or points?

    No, but youâ€™ll receive [a badge on your Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/general/536046) upon course completion!

Day 3: Generative AI Agents - Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process.

Day 4: Domain-Specific LLMs - Delve into the creation and application of specialized LLMs like SecLM and Med-PaLM, with insights from the researchers who built them.

Day 5: MLOps for Generative AI - Discover how to adapt MLOps practices for Generative AI and leverage Vertex AI's tools for foundation models and generative AI applications.

## How the Course Works

- Everyday, youâ€™ll receive an email with assignments. The assignments include an optional podcast episode, new whitepapers to read, and code labs.
- While completing the assignments, youâ€™ll be able to ask questions and discuss with other participants on our Discord channel. The channel will occasionally be monitored by several Google ML researchers and engineers who can answer questions.
- Everyday, [Paige Bailey](https://x.com/DynamicWebPaige?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) will host a YouTube livestream at 11 AM ET/ 13:00 UTC+3 starting on Monday, Nov 11th. Sheâ€™ll be joined by special guests from Google. After the livestream, the recording will be shared on Discord.
- If you complete all of the code labs on Kaggle, by Friday, November 22nd youâ€™ll receive a [Kaggle badge](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/general/536046) on your profile!
